Backing up your Mysterium node is crucial to ensure that your configs and data are safe in case of system failures or data corruption. This guide will walk you through the steps to back up your Mysterium node on both Windows and Linux platforms.

<h2>Compute Workflow</h2>
<p>
  A common method of running a reaction-diffusion simulation on the GPU is to use something that I believe is called “texture ping-ponging”. This involves creating two textures. One texture holds the current state of the simulation to be read, and the other stores the result of the current iteration. After each iteration the textures are swapped.
</p>
<p>
  This method can also be implemented in WebGL using a fragment shader and framebuffers. However, in WebGPU we can achieve the same thing using a compute shader and storage textures as buffers. The advantage of this is that we can write directly to any pixel within the texture we want. We also get the performance benefits that come with compute shaders.
</p>

<h2>Initialisation</h2>
<p>
  The first thing to do is to initialise the pipeline with all the necessary layout descriptors. In addition, all buffers, textures, and bind groups must be set up. The webgpu-utils library really saves a lot of work here.
</p>
<p>
  WebGPU does not allow you to change the size of buffers or textures once they have been created. So we have to distinguish between buffers that don’t change in size (e.g., uniforms) and buffers that change in certain situations (e.g., textures when the canvas is resized). For the latter, we need a method to recreate them and dispose the old ones if necessary.
</p>
<p>
  All textures used for the reaction-diffusion simulation are a fraction of the size of the canvas (e.g., a quarter of the canvas size). The lower amount of pixels to process frees up computing resources for more iterations. Therefore, a faster simulation with relatively little visual loss is possible.
</p>
<p>
  In addition to the two textures involved in the “texture ping-ponging”, there is also a third texture in the demo which I call the seed texture. This texture contains the image data of an HTML canvas on which the clock letters are drawn. The seed texture is used as a kind of influence map for the reaction-diffusion simulation to visualise the clock letters. This texture, as well as the corresponding HTML canvas, must also be recreated/resized when the WebGPU canvas gets resized.
